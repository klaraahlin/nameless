# Nameless Drupal theme

Starting point for development and to allow a clean output of content

## Usage

1. Add to %drupalroot%/sites/all/themes
2. **Rename theme and hooks to a project specific name**
3. update README to contain project specific information

## Technical goals

* html5
* basic html elements should be styled normalized and simple but pretty
* all Drupal elements should be styled or explicitly left out -> normalize
* basic Drupal theme scaffolding, preprocessing and resets should be done
